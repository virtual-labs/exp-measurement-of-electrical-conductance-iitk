<b>Theory of experiment</b>

Materials are usually classified as conductors, semiconductors, or insulators in terms of their behavior toward the flow of current. Conductors have very little resistance to the passage of current. Ohm’s law states that,<br>
<br>
V = i R &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)<br>
<br>
where V is the potential, i is the current and R is the resistance. The resistance depends upon the nature and geometry of the conductor.<br>
<br>
R= ρ <sup>l/A</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)<br>
<br>
In the above equation, l is the distance, A is the area and ρ is the specific resistance. It is more convenient to focus attention on the conductance, L, which is inverse of the resistance, R, for when the conductor is in liquid state, and is expressed in mho or ohm-1. In terms of conductance equation (2) is written as<br>
<br>
L= κ <sup>A/l</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)<br>
<br>
Where κ is the specific conductance, i.e., the conductance of a tube of material 1 cm long having a cross section of 1 cm2. The equivalent conductance (Λ) is defined as the conductance of a solution containing 1 gram equivalent of electrolyte such that the entire solution is placed between two electrodes 1 cm apart. The specific conductance of an electrolyte solution is related to equivalent conductance as<br>
<br>
Λ= κ/c	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)<br>
<br>
where c is the electrolyte concentration (moles cm-3). The equivalent conductance of an electrolyte can be measured by using a conductivity cell. For any conductivity cell, the ratio l/A is a constant known as the cell constant, X, which is determined in every experiment. <br>
<br>
Kohlrausch proposed that when complete dissociation exists in infinite dilution, each ionic species migrates independently. The Λ0 value can be then considered to be the sum of equivalent ionic conductance at infinite dilution<br>

Λ<sub>0</sub>= λ<sub>0</sub><sup>+</sup>+λ<sub>0</sub><sup>-</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)<br>
<br>
Kholrausch additivity law can be used to obtain Λ<sub>0</sub> for a weak electrolyte, which can be further connect to the degree of dissociation of the same.
